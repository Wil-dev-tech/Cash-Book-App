These days, with the ever changing economy, personal finance has never been so important to one's daily life. As someone with a heavy accounting background (2 accounting internships), I have noticed many benefits that comes accounting like:
- Financial Literacy
- Importance of record keeping
- Structure and Order
- Detail Orientation
- etc...

I have acquired these skills through accounting and though I may not be persueing a carear in accounting anymore, I still incorpate these skills in my life through personal financial accounting which have immensely navigate my spendings/income through the current economic landscape.

But after talking to a lot of my peers, it seemsthat outside of the accounting field, accounting have a reputation complicated and hard when it's actually not. I've also noticed that many of the younger generation outside of the accounting and finance fields have limited financial literacy, which often results in making terrible financial decisions and lots of regrets. 

Such actions can be detrimental in today's unstable economy, which is why I made this project, it is a simple cash book app used to condense personal accounting to it's simplest form for beginners, to learn and incorperate the basics of accounting into their lives and enjoy the many beneficial skills from accounting that they can use to improve their personal finance.
